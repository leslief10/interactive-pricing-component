## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

With this project, I learned that inputs with type range are a pain to customize for different browsers. I don't get why for webkit there isn't a range-progress pseudoelement like with Mozilla. Besides that, I learned how to make a toggle switch from scratch which is always helpful. 

### Continued development

I want to make the JS code a bit less wonky. Right now, you need to click on the slider for it to show the right price, and on webkit browsers to show the range track.
